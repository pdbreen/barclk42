===== Installation =====================================

INSTALLATION

System Requirements
BarClock is completely self-contained and requires Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95. BarClock uses very little memory (about 30 k) and uses
almost no system resources.

* If you are using Windows 3.0, use v1.32 of BarClock.
* If you are using Windows NT, use the NT version of BarClock.

Installation from .ZIP file
 1. Create a new directory (such as C:\BARCLOCK).
 2. Unzip the BARCLK42.ZIP archive into this new directory.
 3. Create a new program manager item for BarClock - the command line
    for this icon should read C:\BARCLOCK\BARCLOCK.EXE. I suggest adding
    this icon to your StartUp group.  This will cause BarClock to start
    every time you start Windows.
 4. Double-click the icon to start BarClock.

Automatic Launch
If you chose not to create an icon in your StartUp group and you want
BarClock to start automatically when Windows is started, you can modify
the "load=" line in your WIN.INI file (found in your \WINDOWS
directory) so that it reads "load=barclock.exe".  (NOTE:  Always make a
backup copy of WIN.INI before changing it.)

Checking Installation
If BarClock is installed properly, you will see the BarClock About...
dialog displaying the current version number and important copyright
information.  Click OK to continue and the time and date will appear in
the title bar of the active application. This introductory dialog can
be recalled later by choosing About... from the BarClock menu.

Upgrading a prior version of BarClock
If you are upgrading an older version of BarClock, you will first need
to exit the older version of BarClock.  The new version of BarClock can
be safely installed into the same directory as the prior version and
will retain all existing settings, alarms and timers.

Removing BarClock
Since BarClock does not make any modifications to any of your system
files, if you decide to remove BarClock you simply need to delete a few
files and icons.
 1. Delete all files in your BarClock directory
 2. Delete the following files from your Windows directory
    BARCLOCK.INI configuration file
    BARCLOCK.DAT Alarm/warning/timer data
    BARCLOCK.TXT Default log file
 3. Remove any program icons/groups for BarClock
 4. If you modified your WIN.INI file to load or run BarClock, remember
    to remove BarClock from the line that was modified


===== License for Use and Distribution =================

LICENSE AGREEMENT

Definition of Shareware
Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before
buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you
are expected to register. Individual programs differ on details -- some
request registration while others require it, some specify a maximum
trial period. With registration, you get anything from the simple right
to continue using the software to an updated program with printed
manual.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and the
copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as
stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like
commercial authors, and the programs are of comparable quality. (In
both cases, there are good programs and bad ones!) The main difference
is in the method of distribution. The author specifically grants the
right to copy and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or
to a specific group. For example, some authors require written
permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their Shareware.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You should
find software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's
commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting your needs
easier, because you can try before you buy. And because the overhead is
low, prices are low also. Shareware has the ultimate money-back
guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you don't pay for it.


Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP)
Atomic Dog Software is a member of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware
principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve a
shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the member
directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you
resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide
technical support for members' products.  Please write to the ASP
Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442-9427 USA, FAX
616-788-2765 or send a CompuServe message via CompuServe Mail to ASP
Ombudsman 70007,3536.



DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT

Users of BarClock must accept this disclaimer of warranty:
BARCLOCK IS SUPPLIED AS IS.  THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND OF FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.  THE AUTHOR ASSUMES NO
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, DIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL, WHICH MAY RESULT FROM
THE USE OF BARCLOCK.

BarClock is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to the
user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your friends, but
please do not give it away altered or as part of another system.  The
essence of "user-supported" software is to provide personal computer
users with quality software without high prices, and yet to provide
incentive for programmers to continue to develop new products.  If you
find this program useful and find that you are using BarClock and
continue to use BarClock after 45 days, you must make a registration
payment of $20 to Atomic Dog Software Corporation.  The $20
registration fee will license one copy for use on any one computer at
any one time.  You must treat this software just like a book.  An
example is that this software may be used by any number of people and
may be freely moved from one computer location to another, so long as
there is no possibility of it being used at one location while it's
being used at another.  Just as a book cannot be read by two different
persons at the same time.

Commercial users of BarClock must register and pay for their copies of
BarClock within 45 days of first use or their license is withdrawn.
Site-License arrangements may be made by contacting Atomic Dog Software
Corporation.

Anyone distributing BarClock for any kind of remuneration must first
contact Atomic Dog Software Corporation at the address below for
authorization.  This authorization will be automatically granted to
distributors recognized by the (ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for
shareware distributors, and such distributors may begin offering
BarClock immediately (However Atomic Dog Software Corporation must
still be advised so that the distributor can be kept up-to-date with
the latest version of BarClock.).

You are encouraged to pass a copy of BarClock along to your friends for
evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their copy if they find
that they can use it.

The attached VENDINFO data record is hereby incorporated by reference.
Any distribution satisfying all the distribution requirements expressed
in that data record is hereby authorized.
